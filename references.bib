  abstract = {Integral equation formulations are a competitive strategy in computational electromagnetics but, lamentably, are often plagued by ill-conditioning and by related numerical instabilities that can jeopardize their effectiveness in several real case scenarios. Luckily, however, it is possible to leverage effective preconditioning and regularization strategies that can cure a large majority of these problems. Not surprisingly, integral equation preconditioning is currently a quite active field of research. To give the reader a propositive overview of the state of the art, this paper will review and discuss the main advancements in the field of integral equation preconditioning in electromagnetics summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. The contribution will guide the reader through the choices of the right preconditioner for a given application scenario. This will be complemented by new analyses and discussions which will provide a further and more intuitive understanding of the ill-conditioning of the electric field (EFIE), magnetic field (MFIE), and combined field integral equation (CFIE) and of the associated remedies.},

In addition, the range of validity of these Green's functions is assessed with and without explicit evaluation of the surface wave contributions. As it is well-known, the derivation of the CFGF begins with the approximation of the spectral-domain Green's functions by complex exponentials, and continues with applying the Sommerfeld identity to cast these approximated spectral-domain Green's functions into the space domain in closed forms. Questions and misunderstandings of this derivation, which have mainly originated from the approximation process of the spectral-domain Green's functions in terms of complex exponentials, can be categorized and discussed under the topics of: 1) branch-point contributions; 2) surface wave pole contributions; and 3) the accuracy of the obtained CFGF. When these issues are clarified, the region of validity of the CFGF so obtained may be defined better. Therefore, in this paper, these issues will be addressed first, and then their origins and possible remedies will be provided with solid analysis and numerical demonstrations.},

  abstract = {An important extension of the two-level discrete complex image method is proposed to eliminate any concerns on and shortcomings of the approximations of the spatial-domain Green's functions in closed form in planar multilayered media. The proposed approach has been devised to account for the possible wave constituents of a dipole in layered media, such as spherical, cylindrical, and lateral waves, with the aim of obtaining accurate closed-form approximations of Green's functions over all distances from the source. This goal has been achieved by judiciously introducing an additional level into the two-level approach to pick up the contributions of lateral waves in the spatial domain. As a result, three different three-level algorithms have been proposed, investigated, and shown that they work properly over all ranges of distances from the source. In addition to the accuracy of the results at all distances, these approaches also proved to be robust and computationally efficient as compared to the previous algorithms, which can be attributed to the fact that the sampling of the spectral-domain Green's functions in the proposed approaches gives proper emphasis to the associated singularities of the wave types in the spectral domain. However, the judicious choices of the sampling paths may not be enough to get accurate results from the approximations unless the approximating functions in the spectral domain can provide similar wave natures in the spatial domain. To address this issue, the proposed algorithms employ two different approximations; the rational function fitting methods to capture the cylindrical waves (surface waves), and exponential fitting methods to capture both spherical and lateral waves. It is shown and numerically verified that a linear combination of exponential functions in the spectral domain represent the lateral waves at the interface of the involved layers.},

Specifically, we applied ROSE for the treatment of weak-singular and hypersingular kernels in surface integral equations (SIEs) for the computation of electromagnetic (EM) scattering from perfect electrical conductors (PECs). Different from the existing forward methods, ROSE is based on reverse operations. The singular entries are not evaluated directly by analytical or numerical evaluation; instead, they are introduced as unknowns and are solved algebraically. For EM scattering from PEC, SIEs can be set up by using the Stratton\textendash Chu representation formula. An auxiliary problem with the same meshed boundary is then formulated, of which any plane waves are the self-consistent solutions. It is shown that by applying a consistent discretization, the matrix of the auxiliary problem can be made identical with the original one. As a consequence, these self-consistent solutions can be utilized to solve the singular entries of the original system. Explicitly, a set of plane waves are interpolated using the appropriate basis functions. Subsequently, the corresponding coefficient vectors are utilized to construct small linear systems to solve the troublesome singular entries in the underlying matrix. The proposed ROSE approach is applicable to different singular kernels as well as different discretization schemes. In this paper, we restrict our discussion to the weak-singular and hypersingular kernels using, respectively, div-conformal Rao\textendash Wilton\textendash Glisson basis functions and nonconformal piecewise constant vector basis functions. Accelerated by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm, the proposed method is applicable for real-life applications.},

Reducing the number of translated plane waves has a large impact on the overall performance of the algorithm since the number of plane wave samples considered in the aggregation/disaggregation and interpolation/anterpolation processes can also be reduced. Moreover, the number of required levels within the hierarchical multilevel representation can be considerably reduced in many cases.

  abstract = {A fast inverse equivalent source technique is presented for the fully probe-corrected transformation of measured radiation or scattering fields utilizing directive sources. The directivity of the expansion sources is either obtained by combining electric and magnetic surface current densities in a directive Huygens radiator or by shifting the source locations into complex space. The latter approach is known to generate Gaussian-beam-like directive radiators. These two techniques can be used separately or in combination to obtain three different solutions that approximately satisfy the null-field condition (also known as the Love condition) outside the solution domain, i.e., inside the volume of the original device under test. The directive sources lead to a better conditioning of the inverse problem and especially the Huygens radiator concept leads to good conditioning for a small number of unknowns. Thus, considerable reduction in computation times and better solution accuracies are achieved. Moreover, antenna diagnostics is promoted by the improved localization of the directive equivalent sources. The directive sources are implemented together with Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions and the new concepts are utilized within the fast irregular antenna field transformation algorithm with its hierarchical propagating plane wave-based radiation operator representation. This algorithm has recently been augmented with Gaussian beam-based translation operators which lead to considerably reduced computation times and lower memory requirements.

  abstract = {Automobile antenna measurements become more and more important and especially near-field measurements are very attractive in terms of accuracy, reliability and usefulness. Since automobiles are commonly used on streets within cities or over land, the question of the most appropriate measurement environment for antennas on automobiles is very interesting and there is a need for appropriate near-field far-field transformation approaches. Several measurement approaches for automobile antennas are discussed, where the focus is on an integral equation based near-field far-field transformation technique, which has great flexibility and can be adapted to various measurement environments by working with appropriate Green's functions. Simulation results are shown to highlight some of the capabilities of this method.},

Measurements above a dielectric, possibly lossy halfspace appear to be a good compromise in this respect. We present an efficient inverse equivalent sources solver for the NF farfield (FF) transformation of NF measurements in such an environment. The solver starts from the radiation integrals in free-space with multilevel propagating plane-wave representation of the Green's function and is extended by an appropriate Green's function representation for a halfspace of infinite extent. In order to avoid the cumbersome Sommerfeld integral representation, a very good approximation of the Green's function is utilized, which is shown to exhibit sufficiently good accuracy for the necessary field transformations. The approach is demonstrated by transformation results based on synthetically generated data.},

Rokhlin (1990) to efficiently solve acoustic scattering problems is modified and adapted to the second-kind-integral-equation formulation of electromagnetic scattering problems in two dimensions. The present implementation treats the exterior Dirichlet problem for two-dimensional, closed, conducting objects of arbitrary geometry. The FMM reduces the operation count for solving the second-kind integral equation from O(n/sup 3/) for Gaussian elimination to O(n/sup 4/3/) per conjugate-gradient iteration, where n is the number of sample points on the boundary of the scatterer. A sample technique for accelerating convergence of the iterative method, termed complexifying k, the wavenumber, is also presented. This has the effect of bounding the condition number of the discrete system; consequently, the operation count of the entire FMM (all iterations) becomes O(n/sup 4/3/). Computational results for moderate values of ka, where a is the characteristic size of the scatterer, are given.{$<>$}},

The modifications needed in the integral equation to accommodate simultaneously normal and transverse currents are discussed. Detailed expressions for the Green's functions associated with horizontal and vertical dipoles are presented and cast as Sommerfeld integrals. A convenient integration path is proposed for their estimation. Associated interpolation problems are thoroughly discussed and symmetry and reciprocity considerations are pointed out.

We solve this by analytically continuing the surface of integration. If the surface is a sphere of radius R, this is done by complexifying R to \$R+ia\$. The resulting complex sphere is shown to be a real bundle of disks with radius a tangent to the sphere. Huygens' secondary source points are thus replaced by disks, and his spherical wavelets by well-focused pulsed beams propagating outward. This solves the back-propagation problem. The extended Huygens principle is a completeness relation for pulsed beams, giving a representation of a general radiation field as a superposition of such beams. Furthermore, it naturally yields a very efficient way to compute radiation fields because all pulsed beams missing a given observer can be ignored. Increasing a sharpens the focus of the pulsed beams, which in turn raises the compression of the representation.},

When the beam parameter is set to zero, the Gaussian translation operator reduces to the standard fast multipole method translation operator. The directionality of the Gaussian translation operator makes it possible to reduce the number of plane waves required to achieve a given accuracy. The sampling rate can be determined straightforwardly to achieve any desired accuracy. The use of the computation scheme will be illustrated through a near-field scanning problem where the far-field pattern of a source is determined from near-field measurements with a known probe. Here the Gaussian translation operator improves the condition number of the matrix equation that determines the far-field pattern. The Gaussian translation operator can also be used when the probe pattern is known only in one hemisphere, as is common in practice. Also, the Gaussian translation operator will be used to solve the scattering problem of the perfectly conducting sphere.},

  abstract = {Sequence transformations are important tools for the convergence acceleration of slowly convergent scalar sequences or series and for the summation of divergent series. The basic idea is to construct from a given sequence sn a new sequence sn{${'}$}=T(sn) where each sn depends on a finite number of elements sn1,\ldots,snm. Often, the sn are the partial sums of an infinite series. The aim is to find transformations such that sn{${'}$} converges faster than (or sums) sn. Transformations T(sn,{$\omega$}n) that depend not only on the sequence elements or partial sums sn but also on an auxiliary sequence of the so-called remainder estimates wn are of Levin-type if they are linear in the sn, and nonlinear in the wn. Such remainder estimates provide an easy-to-use possibility to use asymptotic information on the problem sequence for the construction of highly efficient sequence transformations. As shown first by Levin, it is possible to obtain such asymptotic information easily for large classes of sequences in such a way that the wn are simple functions of a few sequence elements sn. Then, nonlinear sequence transformations are obtained. Special cases of such Levin-type transformations belong to the most powerful currently known extrapolation methods for scalar sequences and series. Here, we review known Levin-type sequence transformations and put them in a common theoretical framework. It is discussed how such transformations may be constructed by either a model sequence approach or by iteration of simple transformations. As illustration, two new sequence transformations are derived. Common properties and results on convergence acceleration and stability are given. For important special cases, extensions of the general results are presented. Also, guidelines for the application of Levin-type sequence transformations are discussed, and a few numerical examples are given.},

The application of the MoM in either the spectral or the spatial domain, requires knowledge of the Green's functions in the corresponding domain. In the spatial domain, the Green's functions for stratified media are traditionally represented by the Sommerfeld integral. However, this representation of the Green's functions is not computationally efficient for use in conjunction with the MoM. To overcome this numerical inefficiency for obtaining the spatial-domain Green's functions, they have been approximated by complex images using the Sommerfeld identity; hence, the method is named the discrete complex image method (DCIM). As is the case for most approximations, the closed-form Green's functions have some limitations. Closed-form Green's functions are accurate for small and moderate distances, but for distances larger than a few wavelengths, they deteriorate violently. Three possible sources of this problem are discussed and misunderstandings are clarified.},

  abstract = {Pole-zero modeling of signals, such as an electromagnetic-scatterer response, is considered in this paper. It is shown by use of the pencil-of-functions theorem that a) the true parameters can be recovered in the ideal case [where the signal is the impulse reponse of a rational function H(z)], and b) the parameters are optimal in the functional dependence sense when the observed data are corrupted by additive noise or by systematic error. Although the computations are more involved than in all-pole modeling, they are considerably less than those required in iterative schemes of pole-zero modeling. The advantages of the method are demonstrated by a simulation example and through application to the electromagnetic response of a scatterer. The paper also includes very recent and promising results on a new approach to noise correction. In contradistinction with spectral subtraction techniques, where only amplitude information is emphasized (and phase is ignored), we propose a method that a) estimates the noise spectral density for the data frame, and then b) performs the subtraction of the noise correlation matrix from the Gram matrix of the signal.},

  abstract = {The discrete complex image method (DCIM) has been well-established and widely employed as a tool to compute spatial-domain Green's functions in planar multilayered media. Although the use of the DCIM in conjunction with the method of moments has been quite satisfactory for the efficient analysis of printed structures in layered media, it has not been considered much as a legitimate tool for commercial applications. Up until recently, there has been mainly two reasons for the reluctance of its acceptance in commercial products: the lack of a proper error criterion in the spatial domain and the manual selection of the order of images. As the former shortcoming has recently been eliminated by establishing a proper error criterion in the spatial domain, this paper intends to propose a viable solution for the latter problem, i.e., for the choice of the number of images. Note that, thus far, this choice has been based on the number of significant singular values obtained as a by-product of the method, which is neither rigorous, nor optimum in any sense, and renders it nonrobust and unreliable. As a remedy for this remaining shortcoming, a model selection approach known as minimum description length (MDL) has been introduced into the algorithm of the DCIM with success. The MDL approach, exploiting the regularities in the data, selects the order of the model based on the tradeoff between the quality of fitting and complexity of the model.},

Although the method has been improved and modified several times, not being able to input any prior specification or to get any meaningful assessment on the error deters computer-aided design developers and engineers from using it in the development of commercial software and in-house simulation tools. To remedy this shortcoming of the otherwise very popular DCIM, a weighted p -norm of the spatial-domain error is defined, and its mapping to the spectral domain is derived and proposed as the metric to be used in the implementation of the DCIM. Once this metric is incorporated into the latest three-level DCIM algorithm, used for the approximation of the spatial-domain Green's functions, it is observed that the weighted error-energy minimization in the spectral domain becomes equivalent to the one in the spatial domain. In addition to introducing an error criterion to the DCIM, the leakage problem, which is inherent to the semi-independent processing of subregions in multilevel implementations of the DCIM, is also addressed and eliminated, resulting in a further improvement of the algorithm and the end result.},

  abstract = {In many engineering applications, relatively difficult infinite summations with quite complex terms need to be computed numerically. These applications may include the calculation of free-space or planar-media periodic Green's functions in electromagnetics (EM), the determination of the electrostatic energy of ionic crystals in chemistry and the nucleic acid simulations in molecular dynamics. The difficulty of such computations usually arises from the fast oscillatory and slowly convergent nature of the summations. For instance, the EM analysis of cylindrical geometries may require the computation of slow convergent infinite summations of cylindrical Hankel and Bessel type functions; in numerical simulations of periodic structures, e.g. in the analysis of antenna arrays and photonic band gap materials, the periodic Green's functions need to be calculated for each impedance matrix elements in the method of moments, requiring the evaluation of many infinite summations of complex functions to fill in the entire matrix. In this study, a novel method is proposed to compute slowly convergent summations. In principle, the idea of the method is as follows: if one i) takes a sufficient series of partial sums, and ii) considers them as a set of data, and iii) approximates the data as a sum of complex exponentials, the DC term (the residue of the exponential with zero complex pole) of this approximation would be the result of the summation of interest. The method is quite efficient and robust because of the fact that the partial sums of an infinite summation always exhibit an oscillating behavior, and if the summation is convergent, the oscillation dies out eventually and leads towards a DC term, which is the result of the summation. Therefore, the partial sums are approximated in terms of exponentials to find this zero frequency term. In order to approximate the data as a series of complex exponentials, a subspace approach called the generalized pencil of function (GPOF [1]) is employed. For the sake of demonstration, the method is first applied to a 1-D problem with a known analytical result, and its performance is compared to the direct summation in terms of the computation time. Then, the free-space periodic Green's function (FSPGF) is computed by the proposed method, for its verification in 2-D summations, and the results are compared with those obtained by the Ewald method [2]. It should be noted that, the proposed method can also be applied to 1-D and 2-D slowly convergent infinite integrals by converting them into infinite summations. Since the main idea is the same, once a sufficient set of partial integrals is obtained, the rest of the algorithm becomes exactly the same. However, for the sake of coherence and brevity, no examples on integrations are provided in this study.},

  abstract = {The method of moments (MoM) is widely-used for the solution of mixed potential integral equations (MPIE) arising in the analysis of planar stratified geometries. However, the application of this technique in the spatial domain poses some difficulties since the associated spatial-domain Green's functions for these geometries are improper oscillatory integrals, known as Sommerfeld integrals, that are very computationally-intensive to evaluate. It is possible to eliminate the time-consuming task of computing these integrals by using closed form versions of the spatial domain Green's functions and the time required to evaluate the reaction integrals in the MoM matrix can be reduced considerably. Furthermore, the reaction integrals resulting from the application of the MoM can also be evaluated analytically by using piecewise linear basis and testing functions (Alatan et al., 1996). Hence, an efficient EM simulation algorithm can be developed by using the closed form Green's functions in the MoM formulation that involves no numerical integration. However, despite the time-saving realized from the analytical evaluation of the reaction integrals with the closed-form Green's functions, the need for further reducing the matrix fill-time is not obviated for many problems. Thus the objective of this paper is to present a hybrid technique for the evaluation of the MoM reaction integrals in a numerically-efficient manner that further reduces the time needed for their computation. A microstrip patch antenna is used as an example.},

It is demonstrated that the present image theory reduces to the well-known dipoleimageatcomplex depth forlargedielectric parameters of the half-space. Also, the reflection-coefficient method is obtained as a farfield approximation.

  abstract = {(1) The most obvious mechanical phenomenon in electrical and magnetical experiments is the mutual action by which bodies in certain states set each other in motion while still at a sensible distance from each other. The first step, therefore, in reducing these phenomena into scientific form, is to ascertain the magnitude and direction of the force acting between the bodies, and when it is found that this force depends in a certain way upon the relative position of the bodies and on their electric or magnetic condition, it seems at first sight natural to explain the facts by assuming the existence of something either at rest or in motion in each body, constituting its electric or magnetic state, and capable of acting at a distance according to mathematical laws. In this way mathematical theories of statical electricity, of magnetism, of the mechanical action between conductors carrying currents, and of the induction of currents have been formed. In these theories the force acting between the two bodies is treated with reference only to the condition of the bodies and their relative position, and without any express consideration of the surrounding medium.}

  abstract = {Sommerfeld integration is introduced to calculate the spatial-domain Green's functions (GF) for the method of moments in multilayered media. To avoid time-consuming numerical integration, the discrete complex image method (DCIM) was introduced by approximating the spectral-domain GF by a sum of exponentials. However, traditional DCIM is not accurate in the far- and/or near-field region. Quasi-static and surface-wave terms need to be extracted before the approximation and it is complicated to extract the surface-wave terms. In this paper, some features of the matrix pencil method (MPM) are clarified. A new direct DCIM without any quasi-static and surface-wave extraction is introduced. Instead of avoiding large variations of the spectral kernel, we introduce a novel path to include more variation before we apply the MPM. The spatial-domain GF obtained by the new DCIM is accurate both in the near- and far-field regions. The CPU time used to perform the new DCIM is less than 1 s for computing the fields with a horizontal source-field separation from 1.6/spl times/10/sup -4//spl lambda/ to 16/spl lambda/. The new DCIM can be even accurate up to 160/spl lambda/ provided the variation of the spectral kernel is large enough and we have accounted for a sufficient number of complex images.},

  abstract = {The oscillating infinite domain Sommerfeld integrals (SI) are difficult to integrate using a numerical procedure when dealing with structures in a layered media, even though several researchers have attempted to do that. Generally, integration along the real axis is used to compute the SI. However, significant computational effort is required to integrate the oscillating and slowly decaying function along the tail. Extrapolation methods are generally applied to accelerate the rate of convergence of these integrals. However, there are difficulties with the extrapolation methods, such as locations for the breakpoints. In this paper, we illustrate a simplified approach for accurate and efficient calculation of the integrals dealing with the tails of the SI. In this paper, we fit the tail by a sum of finite (usually 10 to 20) complex exponentials using the matrix pencil method (MPM). The integral of the tail of the SI is then simply calculated by summing some complex numbers. No numerical integration is needed in this process, as the integrals can be done analytically. Good accuracy is achieved with a small number of evaluations for the integral kernel (60 points for the MPM as compared with hundreds or thousands of functional evaluations using the traditional extrapolation methods) along the tails of the SI. Simulation results show that to obtain the similar accuracy in the evaluation of the SI, the MPM is approximately 10 times faster than the traditional extrapolation methods. Moreover, since the MPM is robust to the effects of noise, this method is more stable, especially for large values of the horizontal distances. The method proposed in this paper is thus a new and better technique to obtain accurate results for the computation of the Green's function for a layered media in the spatial domain.},

In this method, the real-axis path of integration is deformed to a contour, which is the steepest-descent path for the exponential function present in the integrand. This new contour also avoids the singularities of the integrand which occur near the original path. The proposed technique is applicable if the radial displacement of the source and field points is electrically small and is most efficient if this displacement is smaller than the vertical separation between these points. Such conditions prevail, for example, in the analysis by means of the integral equation technique of a thin, vertical wire antenna, which penetrates the interface between two media (the so-called ground stake antenna)},

  abstract = {A review is presented of the extrapolation methods for accelerating the convergence of Sommerfeld-type integrals (i.e. semi-infinite range integrals with Bessel function kernels), which arise in problems involving antennas or scatterers embedded in planar multilayered media. Attention is limited to partition-extrapolation procedures in which the Sommerfeld integral is evaluated as a sum of a series of partial integrals over finite subintervals and is accelerated by an extrapolation method applied over the real-axis tail segment (/spl alpha/,/spl infin/) of the integration path, where /spl alpha/{$>$}0 is selected to ensure that the integrand is well behaved. An analytical form of the asymptotic truncation error (or the remainder), which characterizes the convergence properties of the sequence of partial sums and serves as a basis for some of the most efficient extrapolation methods, is derived. Several extrapolation algorithms deemed to be the most suitable for the Sommerfeld integrals are described and their performance is compared. It is demonstrated that the performance of these methods is strongly affected by the horizontal displacement of the source and field points /spl rho/ and by the choice of the subinterval break points. Furthermore, it is found that some well-known extrapolation techniques may fail for a number of values of /spl rho/ and ways to remedy this are suggested. Finally, the most effective extrapolation methods for accelerating Sommerfeld integral tails are recommended.},

  abstract = {A simple method is described that enhances the robustness of the discrete complex image method (DCIM) for Green functions in planar multilayered media. The standard DCIM can fail in the large-p range, where p is the horizontal distance between the source and field-points - even if the guided waves are extracted prior to the complex image approximation. This can occur, in particular, when a significant lateral wave component is present. In the improved method, the spectral kernels are sampled close to the branch point, thus better capturing the lateral wave contribution to the spectrum. As a result, the applicability of the DCIM is extended to larger p values.},

The original historical goal of these integrals was to provide an accurate mathematical description of the electromagnetic phenomena involved in long-distance wireless radio and telegraphy. However, their scope was quickly enlarged thanks to the so-called spectral-domain stratified theory, and now they are ubiquitous in the mathematical models associated to many electromagnetic technologies, ranging from EMC lightning modelization and ground penetrating radar to optical and plasmonic integrated devices and going through the familiar microwave and millimeter-wave planar structures using printed circuit technology. In all these areas, Sommerfeld integrals can provide direct evaluations of the involved electromagnetic fields or they can be used as Green's functions in the frame of integral equation formulations. Other disciplines involving stratified media, like seismology and geological prospection, also benefit from these integrals. After discussing the most canonical Sommerfeld integral, appearing in the so-called Sommerfeld identity, this paper reviews three classical structures, namely, the original Sommerfeld problem involving two semi-infinite media, and the microstrip and stripline geometries. It is shown that Sommerfeld integrals provide a unifying treatment of these three problems and that their mathematical features have a direct translation in terms of the physical properties exhibited by the electromagnetic fields that can exist in them.},

In this paper, we present new results on an approximate Prony method (APM) which is based on [1]. In contrast to [1], we apply matrix perturbation theory such that we can describe the properties and the numerical behavior of the APM in detail. The number of sampled data acts as regularization parameter. The first part of APM estimates the frequencies and the second part solves an overdetermined linear Vandermonde-type system in a stable way. We compare the first part of APM also with the known ESPRIT method. The second part is related to the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT).

This strategy first builds up a pole-free characteristic function and then makes use of a root-searching scheme based on an integral nature method to search for its zeros. For uncovered waveguides, the branch points of the characteristic function can be removed by introducing the upper half-space vertical wavenumber as the working variable. Examples of the efficiency, reliability, and robustness of the presented technique are given for both covered and uncovered waveguides, which sets up this technique as a very convenient CAD tool. The method is also applied to study a new and interesting problem: the evolution of the modes of a grounded dielectric waveguide when increasing the permittivity of the upper semi-infinite medium. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All of these techniques, in other words, seek the same quantitative parameters to represent the sampled data, but use different routes to get there. The techniques for estimating the parameters are either linear or nonlinear. The linear techniques are emphasized in this presentation. In particular, the matrix pencil method is described, which is more robust to noise in the sampled data. The matrix pencil approach has a lower variance of the estimates of the parameters of interest than a polynomial-type method (Prony's method belongs to this category), and is also computationally more efficient.

  abstract = {In 1912 Sommerfeld introduced his radiation condition to ensure the uniqueness of the solution of certain exterior boundary value problems in mathematical physics. In physical applications these problems generally describe wave propagation where an incident time-harmonic wave is scattered by an object, and the resulting diffracted or scattered waves need to be calculated. When formulated mathematically, these problems usually take the form of an exterior Dirichlet or Neumann problem for the Helmholtz partial differential equation. The Sommerfeld condition is applied at infinity and, when added to the statement of the boundary value problem, singles out only the solution which represents ``outgoing'' (rather than ``incoming'' or ``standing'') waves in the physical applications. Since its introduction, the Sommerfeld radiation condition has become indispensable for these types of problems and has stimulated a considerable amount of mathematical research, especially in uniqueness theorems. The present note traces the motivation and reasoning that led Sommerfeld to the original formulation of his radiation condition and surveys the extensions and modifications this condition has undergone since then. R\'esum\'e En 1912 Sommerfeld introduisit sa condition de rayonnement pour assurer l'unicit\'e de la solution de certains probl\`emes ext\'erieurs de valeurs au bord en physique math\'ematique. Dans les applications physiques ces probl\`emes d\'ecrivent en g\'en\'eral des propagations d'ondes, o\`u une onde harmonique incidente est diffract\'ee par un objet et l'on cherche \`a calculer l'onde diffract\'ee ou dispers\'ee. Quand on les formule math\'ematiquement, ces probl\`emes prennent le plus souvent la forme d'un probl\`eme de Dirichlet ou de Neumann ext\'erieur pour l'\'equation aux d\'eriv\'ees partielles de Helmholtz. La condition de Sommerfeld est appliqu\'ee \`a l'infini et, quand on l'ajoute \`a l'\'enonc\'e du probl\`eme au bord, elle s\'el\'ectionne la seule solution qui dans les applications physiques repr\'esente les ondes ``sortantes'' (et non pas les ``entrantes'' ou ``stationnaires''). Depuis son introduction la condition de rayonnement de Sommerfeld est devenue indispensable pour les probl\`emes de ce type et a stimul\'e une grande quantit\'e de recherches math\'ematiques, en particulier des th\'eor\`emes d'unicit\'e. La note pr\'esente retrace la motivation et le raisonnement qui ont conduit Sommerfeld \`a la formulation originale de sa condition de rayonnement et passe en revue les extensions et modifications que cette condition a subi depuis. Zusammenfassung Im Jahre 1912 f\"uhrte Sommerfeld die nach ihm benannte Ausstrahlungsbedingung ein, um die Eindeutigkeit der L\"osung von gewissen \"ausseren Randwertaufgaben in der mathematischen Physik zu sichern. In physikalischen Anwendungen beschreiben diese Aufgaben im allgemeinen Wellenausbreitungen, in denen eine eintreffende harmonische Welle durch ein Hindernis gestreut wird und die hierdurch entstehenden gebeugten oder gestreuten Wellen zu berechnen sind. Mathematisch formuliert nehmen diese Aufgaben meistens die Gestalt eines Dirichletschen oder Neumannschen Problems f\"ur die Helmholtzsche Schwingungsgleichung in einem Aussengebiet an. Die Sommerfeldsche Bedingung wird im Unendlichen angewandt und w\"ahlt, wenn der Formulierung der Randwertaufgabe beigef\"ugt, nur die L\"osung aus, die ``divergierende'' (und nicht etwa ``konvergierende'' oder ``stehende'') Wellen in den physikalischen Anwendungen darstellt. Seit ihrer Einf\"uhrung ist die Sommerfeldsche Ausstrahlungsbedingung f\"ur Aufgaben dieser Art unentbehrlich geworden und hat auf die mathematische Forschung\textemdash besonders die Unit\"atss\"atze betreffend\textemdash f\"ordernd gewirkt. Die vorliegende Arbeit sucht, die Beweggr\"unde und \"Uberlegungen aufzufinden, die Sommerfeld zur Originalfassung seiner Ausstrahlungsbedingung veranlassten, und gew\"ahrt einen \"Uberblick \"uber die Erweiterungen und \"Anderungen, die diese Bedingung seitdem erfahren hat.},

The integration along steepest descent paths and leading-order approximations are introduced to evaluate these Sommerfeld integrals, which can greatly accelerate the computation. Based on the fast evaluation of Sommerfeld integrals, the radiation of an arbitrarily oriented electric dipole buried in a half space is first analyzed and computed. Then, the scattering by buried dielectric objects and conducting objects is considered using the method of moments (MOM). Numerical results show that the fast method can save tremendous CPU time in radiation and scattering problems involving buried objects.},

In this review, an attempt is made to describe the ground-wave mechanism that is omni-present. We first call attention to the early analytical contributions of Zenneck and Sommerfeld, based on a flat-Earth model. The subsequent controversies, particularly with regard to the role of the Zenneck surface wave, are outlined. Further developments by other pioneers, such as van der Pol, Fock, Bremmer, Norton, and Millington, are reviewed, and an attempt is made to put these in a modern context. We also show that the trapped surface wave can be a significant contribution to the total ground-wave field, when the Earth boundary is sufficiently inductive. Mixed-path theory and confirming model tests by Ray King are described briefly, along with calculated propagation curves for twoand three-section paths. The bibliography includes references to related topics, such as tropospheric refraction and topographic influences.},
